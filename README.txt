RehabConnex is a middleware for connecting and patching (Rehab-)Devices and Games for LAN or Internet. The main structure works with clients, devices & slots. The protocol is simple and uses add/remove/set/get/patch to create, get, set, stream and connect devices over TCP/IP (like FTP or SMTP). The middleware can handle several games and devices over the same running service.

RehabConnex was written in Mono (C# for Win/Mac/Linux). 
The used dev-kit is Monodevelop (http://www.monodevelop.com)
